A TCP retransmission occurs when the receiver of data acknowledges that it received the initial transmission but sends incorrect data back to the sender. The most likely cause is an error in sending or receiving the data, such as a missing or corrupted header field, a malformed frame, or a packet loss. To remedy this issue, you should check the TCP flags and sequence numbers of the packets involved, and resend any corrupted or lost packets using the correct headers and sequences. You can also use flow control mechanisms to prevent congestion or buffer overflow that could cause data corruption.\n"

      "llm_response": " Anomalies and Remediation Steps:\n- The \"header_len\" field is zero, which indicates a packet with an invalid or corrupted header length value. This could be caused by a variety of issues, such as a misconfigured TCP port number, a faulty network interface card, or a buggy protocol implementation. To fix this issue, the user should check their network configuration and verify that the IP and port numbers are correctly set for the application. They may also need to update their network driver or firmware if the problem persists.\n- The \"payload_len\" field is 10, which does not match the expected payload length of 16 bytes for a TCP data packet. This could be caused by an error in parsing or encoding the binary payload, or a malformed or invalid message format. To fix this issue, the user should inspect the raw_payload field and ensure that it contains only valid ASCII characters. They may also need to use a different protocol or method of sending and receiving data, such as JSON or XML, if the messages are too complex or variable in size.\n- The \"src_port\", \"dst_port\", and \"ack\" fields are out of range for their respective ports (10310 and 10001). This could be caused by a mismatch between the network interface card and the system's IP address, or a deliberate attempt to spoof or hijack the traffic. To fix this issue, the user should verify that their network cards are configured correctly and assign different port numbers for each interface. They may also need to use encryption or authentication mechanisms, such as SSL/TLS or MAC addresses, to secure their communication and prevent unauthorized access or modification of the packets.\n"

We can also use a reliable transport layer, such as SSL/TLS or IPsec, to ensure data integrity and security.
