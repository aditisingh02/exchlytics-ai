The type of error indicated is a \"TCP Retransmission\" error. \n\nThe details within this error provide some context to understand the nature of the issue. It indicates that the source (127.0.1.100) sent a data packet to the destination (128.0.0.98), but there was an unsuccessful transmission. The source port is 10310, while the destination port is 10001. \n\nIt's important to note that further information about the error would be needed to accurately diagnose and fix it. However, based on this partial information, it seems that a TCP retransmission may be necessary in order for the connection to resume successfully.\n"

The server is sending corrupted data, which means that either the header fields or the raw payload are incorrect or incomplete. This could be caused by a buffer overflow in the connection, a malicious packet injection, or a software bug in the TCP stack. To fix this error, the user should check their network settings and firewall rules to make sure they are configured properly and not blocking any legitimate traffic. They should also scan their system for malware or viruses that could be compromising their security. Additionally, they can try using a different port or protocol to establish a new connection with the server, as TCP errors may indicate a compatibility issue.\n"

The first message was lost or corrupted and the receiver did not receive it completely. The retransmission tries to correct this problem by sending a new message with the same sequence number, acknowledgment number, payload length, header length, checksum, options, and raw payload as the original message. However, some of these fields may have changed due to network delays or errors, such as the timestamp (which represents the time the packet was sent). In this case, the new message is received by the receiver at a later time than expected, which may cause confusion or conflict with other messages that were not retransmitted. To prevent or minimize TCP retransmission errors, it is recommended to use acknowledgments, keepalive, and timeout mechanisms in the protocol.\n"
